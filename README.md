# Obstacle-Avoidance-Car-master
## CSEN 605 : Digital System Design Project Semester 5
This is the source code for Obstacle avoidance car using FPGA written in VHDL . we use 4 ultrasonic sensors to observe the obstacles 2 of them (with their signal Ored) are used to detect front obstacles and one for the left and right sides of the car we also use light sensor such that if the light is turned off the car won't move .
